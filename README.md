These are some attempts to write some tools for working with optical genome mapping data.

Initially, this is a simple FASTA indexer and aligner. The input data format for the aligner is a Bionano BNX file.
The alignment operates on the gap distance between labels and attempts to find the best alignments across a reference
genome.
